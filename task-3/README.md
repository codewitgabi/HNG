:rocket: Stage 3 Backend Task

---

\
For this fun task, you have major challenges to complete to move on in this journey.

- Form a Squad:
  Break into teams of 5 members only (Five members for each team). Feel free to pick your team mates, particularly those living close to you. Collaboration, trust and team work is key!
  <br/>
- Objective:
  Access these boilerplates URLs below, decide whichever repo your team will be contributing to. Ensure you follow the contribution guidelines. Read well this time around.
  <br/>

- https://github.com/hngprojects/hng_boilerplate_python_fastapi_web
- https://github.com/hngprojects/hng_boilerplate_nestjs
- https://github.com/hngprojects/hng_boilerplate_golang_web
- https://github.com/hngprojects/hng_boilerplate_node_web
- https://github.com/hngprojects/hng_boilerplate_csharp_web
- https://github.com/hngprojects/hng_boilerplate_php_laravel_web

In the project or repo of your choice, make sure you complete the following :

- **API Design**: Collaboratively craft a proper and complete API design for the boilerplate repo (you chose) using OpenAPI. Think of every detail and make us proud.
  <br />
- **Database Design**: Create a database blueprint/design. Ensure it robust, well structured and visible.

Submission: Once your API and database designs are completed and ready for submission,

- Fork any of the boilerplate repo.
- Create a new branch using your squad/group name.
- Prepare a detailed ReadMe file with your API design and Database Design. You can include links to your design in the ReadMe file
- Submit your URL to your FORKED repo branch to the submission form provided.

**Note:**
Your team will be judged as a unit. You get promoted as a group as well can fail as a group. So choose wisely :slightly_smiling_face:.
